# jobseekers_social_network

This is basically a website for recruiter and the job seekers. The project is implemented in Object Oriented PHP as the main language and
fragments of JavaScript as well as its frameworks such as Jquery and AJAX are used to implement the search functions and for implementing quiz.
The project would give a good idea of how the CMS(CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) works.
